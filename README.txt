# 335-05 Project 1 Cella Ant #12
Team: JVU
Team Member: James Vu

## Intro
This program simulates Turk and Propp's Ant #12 where an ant crawl and changes its direction and changes the cell color under it. For Ant #12, the ant turns right on black and red and turns left on yellow and blue. This program does 1000 moves for Ant #12. This program uses a function that recursively calls itself for N moves. This function calls other functions to turn the ant, change cell state, and move the ant forward. There is also a delay included for D milliseconds to show the grid changing after every move. Using a text editor, you can change N and D to change the moves and delay respectively.
